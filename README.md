# Signals Notebook Dracula Theme

## Installation

**Easy Installation:**

1. Install the Stylus extension ([Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)) ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)). This extension allows you to add custom styling (CSS) onto webpages like Signals Notebook.
2. Open the extension and go to `Manage` > `Get and share styles` (bottom left), which should take you to the website `userstyles.world`.
3. Search "Signals Notebook" and look for the entry "Signals Notebook Dracula Theme by IsoPhoenix"
4. Install the theme. You can disable/reenable it any time through the Stylus extension! Just go to `Manage` > `Signals Notebook` and check/uncheck the `Enabled` box and hit `Save`.

**Manual Installation:**

You can also create a new style in the Stylus extension, then paste in the CSS code from the `signals-dracula.css` file in this GitHub repository. Set the style to target URLs starting with `ucberkeleysite.signalsresearch2.revvitycloud.com/elements/`.
